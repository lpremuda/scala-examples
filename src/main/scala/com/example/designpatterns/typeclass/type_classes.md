# Type Classes
A group of types that satisfy a contract typically defined by a trait.
### Introduction
- Used to achieve ad-hoc polymorphism
- No native Scala support, but created via traits and implicit classes

From Cats typelevel: Where many object-oriented languages leverage subtyping for polymorphic code, functional programming tends towards a combination of parametric polymorphism (think type parameters, like Java generics) and ad-hoc polymorphism
